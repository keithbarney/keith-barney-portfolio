              p.project-description No formal design system existed — multiple domain teams independently created UI patterns with only a style guide for loose guidance, leading to inconsistency, ongoing debate, and slow decision-making. Led the creation of the first reusable component libraries across iOS, Android, and Web. Established the foundational token architecture, typography scale, and a design QA process for reviewing projects against system standards. Built Slack support channels and intake workflows to operationalize the system. Pushed back on skeptical engineering by demonstrating the value of centralized decisions, reusable code, and faster shipping with baked-in accessibility. The effort formalized into Experian's first official design systems team, and design leadership mandated all new projects use the system.

              h2.project-name Atlas Component Merge
              p.project-description Platform-specific Figma libraries for web, iOS, and Android had evolved independently, with web further fragmented into separate mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints. Duplicated patterns, inconsistent behavior, and growing maintenance overhead demanded unification. Co-led the merge effort, dividing the component list and releasing in waves over two months. Created a formal four-step deprecation process with Slack announcements, Loom walkthroughs, and one-on-one designer check-ins to manage the transition. The merge eliminated redundant Figma frames, centralized design decisions across platforms, and reduced platform-switching overhead. Designers' Figma proficiency increased significantly as a direct result of the hands-on migration support.

              h2.project-name Atlas Audit
              p.project-description Multiple UI systems coexisted in production — Legacy, Next, Atlas, and SDUI — with no visibility into what was actually running. Adoption remained abstract and impossible to operationalize. Autonomously conceived and prototyped a design system adoption tool that made tech debt visible and actionable. Designed the full experience in Figma and collaborated directly with engineers on feasibility and feedback. The tool surfaced work for an offshore engineering team running low on tasks, preventing wasted contract time and money. Turned abstract adoption conversations into concrete, prioritized work items for product managers. The initiative inspired other team members to start building their own internal tools — shifting the culture from ticket-taking to problem-solving.

              p.project-description Co-founded a workplace collaboration platform that helped companies surface hidden problems and ideas from across their organizations. Owned all design work from the ground up — branding, product UI, and marketing site — while leading a remote development team of six engineers through daily ceremonies and sprint management. Shipped a product that real companies adopted to crowdsource solutions, vote on priorities, and turn employee insight into concrete decisions. The platform reached break-even and remains live today. The experience shaped how I think about building products from zero, leading distributed teams, and designing systems where the most important information rises to the top.

              p.project-description Joined as Lead Designer and Design System Manager, inheriting a product with no shared design language and a team of six designers working independently. Built the company's first design system from scratch while establishing a formal UX review process that brought structure and accountability to design decisions across the team. The review process created a shared quality bar — designers presented work against system standards, caught inconsistencies early, and aligned on patterns before engineering handoff. Managed the team through the transition from ad-hoc design to systems thinking, balancing the need for consistency with each designer's autonomy and domain expertise. The system and review process reduced redundant work, improved design-to-engineering communication, and created a foundation the team could build on independently.
